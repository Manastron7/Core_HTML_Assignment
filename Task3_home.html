    <p><b>Hi Manas Nayak here.</b> This is my small blog and an attempt to see my skill in HTML understanding. I am still noob in this field and hoping to learn more and create some good end project that might be liked by many and used by some. <br><br>I have done my schoolin in Kendriya Vidyalaya. After 12<sup>th</sup> I pursue my interest in physics which did workout well. Guess what I completed my BSc degree in physics and then started doing my master in physics that course I left in between as too scared of the course and syllabus.<br><br> Soon I joined call center that did paid me well to sustain my life but not gave me satisfaction that i am doing somthing great, hence I joined this course to enhance my skill in coding. As they say <i style="background-color: yellow"> practice make the man perfect</i> so i am on it</p>
