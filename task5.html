    <h1>Full stack web Development Tech Stack</h1>
    <p>A technology stack is like a set of building blocks for creating a website or app. Just as you stack different types of blocks to build something, a technology stack stacks different technologies on top of each other to make a website or app work.It consists of the <b style="background-color: yellow;">Front-end</b> which is like the design and user interface, and the <b style="background-color: yellow">Back-end</b> which is the hidden infrastructure. The stack you choose determines your project's possibilities, uniqueness, and resource requirements, much like selecting Lego pieces to build different things.</p><hr>
    <h2><u>The below list is of Tack stack</u></h2>
    <dl>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">Full stack tech stack</dt>
        <dd>This is the most common type of stack used in desktop web applications. It consists of both front-end and back-end technologies—for example, Angular for the UI, a framework like Django for the application logic, and a database like MongoDB for managing data.</dd><br>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">Front-end</dt>
        <dd>Front end is main companent of Tech stack which is responsible for user interface.Front-end developers work with various technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build the visual and interactive aspects of a site that users interact with directly. Front end tech stack contains 3 parts that is browser (Desktop, mobile), Programing language, Frameworks.</dd><br>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">User interface</dt>
        <dd>You can use markup like HTML and CSS stylesheets, or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, depending on the styling needs of the project.</dd><br>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">Programming languages</dt>
        <dd>Programming languages take care of the important business logic that your applications need. Some top programming languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, PHP, and C#.</dd><br>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>Frameworks provide a structure to the application and have common utilities so that you don’t have to write every piece of logic from scratch. Some popular web frameworks are Express, Spring, Django, Laravel, Rails, and .NET.</dd><br>
        <dt style="background-color: aqua; display: inline;">Backend tech stack</dt>
        <dd>The backend or server-side tech stack consists of many components, like database, server, framework, and operating system. You have to choose the server-side frameworks and tools carefully, because some technologies are lightweight, fast, and suitable for basic purposes, whereas some are loaded with features that only a complex application might need.</dd><br>
